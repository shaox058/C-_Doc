1. vptr and vtbl
    vptr is a hidden pointer added by the Compiler to the base class. And this pointer is pointing to the virtual table of that particular class.
    vtbl is a lookup table of function pointers used to dynamically bind the virtual functions to objects at runtime

3. Dynamic Binding
  a.Dynamic binding occurs when a pointer or reference is associated with a member function based on the
    dynamic type of the object.
  b.Dynamic binding occurs at run time
  c.Must override a virtual function declared in a direct or indirect base class.
4. Const
                        const object        non-const object
 const member func         Yes                 Yes
 non const member func     No                  Yes
 
5. overload ::operator new
void* operator new(size_t size)
{
    //...
}

6. overload ::operator delete
void operator delete(void* ptr)
{
    //...
}

7. overload ::operator new[]
void* operator new[](size_t size)
{
    //...
}

8. overload ::operator delete[]
void operator delete[](void* ptr)
{
    //...
}

9. overload member new/delete
class Foo
{
public:
    ...
    void* operator new(size_t size)
    {
        //...
    }
    void operator delete(void* ptr)
    {
        //...
    }
    ...
};

10. overload member new[]/delete[]

class Foo
{
public:
    ...
    void* operator new[](size_t size)
    {
        //...
    }
    void operator delete[](void* ptr)
    {
        //...
    }
    ...
};
