Week1

1. Header Guard
#ifndef __XXX__
#def __XXX__

  class declaration
  class body

#endif

2. template 

template <typename T> T abc(T a, T b)
{
	return (a+b);
}

3. Inline vs Marco

#define ADD(a,b) (a+b)

inline int ADD(int a, int b)
{
	return (a+b);
}
Similarity:
  save function excess time
Different:
  a.inline function are parsed and expanded by the complier, whereas macros are just textual substitution and expanded by the preprocessor
  b.inline functions can be overloaded
  c.Based on my experince, macros are used for code reuse wherars the inline function are used to  during function call.
  
4. Public, private, protect

   Public: are accessible by anywhere.
   Private: are accessible only from the same class or from friends
   protected: are accessible from the same class or from friends or drived classess
   
5. friend

6. Const
  a. const variable
  
  b. const functions
  
  c. const member functions
  
  d. const member variable
  
  e. const class
  
7. Constructor
  a.default argument
  
  b.initialization list
  
  c.assignments
  
  d.overloading
  
  e.constructor in private
    Singleton
    
8. pass by value vs pass by refernce

9. return by value vs return by reference

10. Operator overloading member function

11. Operator overloading non-member function

12. Features of OOP
    a.Abstraction
    b Polymorphism
    c.Inheritance
    d Encapsulation
