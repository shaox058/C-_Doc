Week2 

1.Big Three
   a. copy constructor
   if no define, the complier will have a synthesized copy constructor wihch is a Shallow Copy
   inline String :: String(const String& str)
   {
  
      m_data = new char[strlen(str.m_data +1)]
      strcpy(m_data, str.m_data);

      
   }
   b. copy assignment operator
   have self assignment, othwise the data pointed by member poionter will be deleted 
   copy asignment operator must copy member data from parent's class
   inline String& String::operator=(const String& str)
   {
      if (this == &str) return *this;//self assigment
      delte[] m_data;
      m_data = new char[strlen(str.m_data +1)]
      strcpy(m_data, str.m_data);
      return *this;
      
   }
   c. destructor
      cannot be overloaded
      one class one destructor
      first excute function body, then destroy data member
             
2. If class with pointer, you must define Big three

3. Memory management
    a. three steps for new
      <1>. CALL MALLOC
          void * mem = operator new (sizeof(XX))
      <2>. TYPE CONVERSION 
          ps = static_cast<XX *>(mem);
      <3>.CONSTRUCTOR 
          ps->XX::XX(); 
    b. two steps for delete
       <1>. XX::~XX(ABC);//destructor
       <2>. operator delete(ABC); //FREE mem
    
    c. After array new, must have array delte, otherwise memory leak
        string * p = new string[100];
         ...
         delete[] p;//Call 100 times destructor
4. Stack and heap
   Stack: a memory sapce/lifecycle within a scope

   Heap: a global block or some blocks allocated dynamiclly by OS
