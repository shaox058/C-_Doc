Week2 

1.Big Three
   a. copy constructor
   
   b. copy assignment operator
   
   c. destructor
   
   
2. If class with pointer, you must define Big three

3. Memory management
    a. three steps for new
      <1>. CALL MALLOC
          void * mem = operator new (sizeof(XX))
      <2>. TYPE CONVERSION 
          ps = static_cast<XX *>(mem);
      <3>.CONSTRUCTOR 
          ps->XX::XX(); 
    b. two steps for delete
       <1>. XX::~XX(ABC);//destructor
       <2>. operator delete(ABC); //FREE mem
    
    c. After array new, must have array delte, otherwise memory leak
        string * p = new string[100];
         ...
         delete[] p;//Call 100 times destructor
4. Stack and heap
   Stack: a memory sapce/lifecycle within a scope

   Heap: a global block or some blocks allocated dynamiclly by OS
